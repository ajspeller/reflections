What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	That just means that you are letting git know that you want to start an repo in that folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area give you the opportunity to see which file will be committed before actually running the commit command.  The value is that you are less likely to mistakenly commit files to your repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	You can compare the staging area to the repository to ensure that you have one commit per logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branched are good if you were to update the project to a new language or to try to implement a new experimental update while keeping the master copy of the software intact.

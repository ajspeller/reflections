How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped because I did not have to concentrate on each line of the entire file.  I was able to execute the FC program and have it target the differences.  At that point I could make a decision based on the recognized differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If I have the entire history of the file then I dont have to retain copies of the same file with slightly different names.  It also allows me to see how the file has gradually changed over time.
